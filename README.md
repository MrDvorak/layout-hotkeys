# Layout Hotkeys

This **GNOME Shell** extension aims to provide direct hotkeys for input layouts.

The default **GNOME Shell** does not have such functionality and requires a user to cycle through all layouts,
what is not a convenient way for more than two different input layouts.

## Usage

Press **Shift + Alt + *N***, and the input layout number ***N*** will be selected.

## Manual Intallation

~~~ bash
./install.sh
~~~

After a successful installation, re-log into **GNOME Shell**, and enable the extension in **Extensions**.

## License

This **GNOME Shell** extension is distributed under the terms of the **GNU General Public License**,
version **2** or later. See the *LICENSE* file for details.
