# Layout Hotkeys

This **GNOME Shell** extension aims to provide direct hotkeys for input layouts.

The default **GNOME Shell** does not have such functionality and requires a user to cycle through all layouts,
what is not a convenient way for more than two different input layouts.

## How-to Use

Press **Shift + Alt + *N***, and the input layout number ***N*** will be selected.
